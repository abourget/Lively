Here are some scripts to administer the Redis database and thus the Events themselves.

These scripts should:

* Add a key for an event (like liveblog007)
* Configure that event with a password for publishers, and a password for moderators
* Configure if you want to allow comments on that channel
* Build an Android app that is already linked to your channel
